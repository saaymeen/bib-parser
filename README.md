# BIB Parser

A BibTeX parser implementation for the software engineering internship at TU Chemnitz 2020.

The project is currently under development - the tool is **neither** complete **nor** working.

## Building from source

BIB Parser requires C++ compiler supporting the C++17 standard, and CMake installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saaymeen/bib-parser.git
mkdir bib-parser/build
cd bib-parser/build
cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" .. # Pick your favourite generator
make -j4 # Number of cores
```
